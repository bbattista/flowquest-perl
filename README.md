# flowquest-perl
Perl Script for reading LinkQuest's FlowQuest 300 data.

Very beta, just using it for a personal project at the moment.  It can extract data from instrument files and populate MySQL table or write to CWP-Seismic Unix data files.  

adcp.sql: MySQL table structure
readFlowQuest.pl: main script
flowquest.pm: object and subroutines acting on the data files
